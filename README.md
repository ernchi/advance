# advance
The front-end/ dashboard team dev branch, where all changes/ commits are made. 

Things to work on next semester:
1. Display the suggestions recieved from the survey server. 
2. Fix any existing issues in the pages. (Survey questions are not displaying properly if questions are too long, dashboard still needs improving, web pages need to scale dynamically to different sizes)
3. Work with survey team to link the correct survey url. (Currently retrieving information from a temporary survey server)
